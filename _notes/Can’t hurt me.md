### Цитаты:

> «Don’t stop when you are tired. Stop when you are done»

> «when you’re driven, whatever is in front of you, whether it’s racism, sexism, injuries, divorce, depression, obesity, tragedy, or poverty, becomes fuel for your metamorphosis»

> Why am I here? - спрашивай себя в тяжелые моменты. «Know why you’re in the fight to stay in the fight!»

> «What am I capable of?  
> I couldn’t answer that question, but as I looked around the finish line that day and considered what I’d accomplished, it became clear that we are all leaving a lot of money on the table without realizing it.
